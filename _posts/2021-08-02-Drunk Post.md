本文摘自 [Drunk Post: Things I've learned as a Sr Engineer](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/nmodyl/drunk_post_things_ive_learned_as_a_sr_engineer/)

I'm drunk and I'll probably regret this, but here's a drunken rank of things I've learned as an engineer for the past 10 years.

我喝醉了，我可能会后悔，但这是我作为工程师在过去 10 年里学到的东西。

- The best way I've advanced my career is by changing companies.

  推进职业生涯的最好方式就是跳槽。

- Technology stacks don't really matter because there are like 15 basic patterns of software engineering in my field that apply. I work in data so it's not going to be the same as webdev or embedded. But all fields have about 10-20 core principles and the tech stack is just trying to make those things easier, so don't fret overit.

  技术栈并不重要，因为我的领域有15种基本的软件工程模式。我做的是大数据，因此和 Web 开发或者嵌入式不大相同。但所有领域都有大约 10 - 20 个核心原则，技术栈只是为了让这些事情更容易，所以不要担心过度。

- There's a reason why people recommend job hunting. If I'm unsatisfied at a job, it's probably time to move on.

  人们推荐找工作是有原因的。当我对工作不满意的时候，就是我继续前进的时候了。

- I've made some good, lifelong friends at companies I've worked with. I don't need to make that a requirement of every place I work. I've been perfectly happy working at places where I didn't form friendships with my coworkers and I've been unhappy at places where I made some great friends.

  我在之前的公司交了一些好朋友。交朋友不是一个工作地点的必需品。在交到好朋友的公司我可能工作得并不开心，但在没有交到好朋友的公司我可能工作得很开心。

- I've learned to be honest with my manager. Not too honest, but honest enough where I can be authentic at work. What's the worse that can happen? He fire me? I'll just pick up a new job in 2 weeks.

  我学会了对我的经理实话实说。我可以在工作中是很实诚的。你以为会因此发生什么糟糕的事情吗？他解雇我？我两周后就能找到新工作。

- If I'm awaken at 2am from being on-call for more than once per quarter, then something is seriously wrong and I will either fix it or quit.

  如果我每季度不止一次在凌晨 2 点从待命状态中醒来，那么就出大问题了。我要么尝试解决，要么退出这个项目。

- pour another glass

  再续一杯酒

- Qualities of a good manager share a lot of qualities of a good engineer.

  一个好经理应当拥有一个好工程师的很多优秀品质。

- When I first started, I was enamored with technology and programming and computer science. I'm over it.

  刚开始的时候，我沉迷科技、编程和计算机科学。现在不行了。

- Good code is code that can be understood by a junior engineer. Great code can be understood by a first year CS freshman. The best code is no code at all.

  良好的代码是初级工程师也可以理解的代码。伟大的代码是一年级 CS 新生可以理解的代码。最好的代码就根本不是代码。

- The most underrated skill to learn as an engineer is how to document. Fuck, someone please teach me how to write good documentation. Seriously, if there's any recommendations, I'd seriously pay for a course (like probably a lot of money, maybe 1k for a course if it guaranteed that I could write good docs.)

  作为一名工程师，最被低估的技能是写文档。妈的，有没有人教教我如何写好文档。说真的，如果有人能给出建议，我会为这门课程付钱（可能会给很多钱，如果它保证我可以写好文档，我可以付 1000 美刀。

- Related to above, writing good proposals for changes is a great skill.

  同上，把改动需求的提案写好也是一项伟大的技能。

- Almost every holy war out there (vim vs emacs, mac vs linux, whatever) doesn't matter... except one. See below.

  几乎每一个神圣的战争（vim 和 emacs，mac 和 linux，等等等等）都并不重……除了下面要讲的那个。

- The older I get, the more I appreciate dynamic languages. Fuck, I said it. Fight me.

  年龄越大，就越欣赏动态语言。妈的，这就是我说的。有本事跟我打一架。

- If I ever find myself thinking I'm the smartest person in the room, it's time to leave.

  如果我发现自认为是部门里最厉害的人，那就是时候离开了。

- I don't know why full stack webdevs are paid so poorly. No really, they should be paid like half a mil a year just base salary. Fuck they have to understand both front end AND back end AND how different browsers work AND networking AND databases AND caching AND differences between web and mobile AND omg what the fuck there's another framework out there that companies want to use? Seriously, why are webdevs paid so little.

  我不知道全栈 Web 开发工资怎么这么低。他们应该半年的基本工资就有 50 W。妈的，他们又要了解前端，还要了解后端，还要了解不同的浏览器是怎么工作的，还要了解网络和数据库，还要了解缓存，还要了解网络和移动之间的差异，还要他妈的了解还有公司想使用的另一个框架？说真的，为什么报酬这么少。

- We should hire more interns, they're awesome. Those energetic little fucks with their ideas. Even better when they can question or criticize something. I love interns.

  我们应该雇佣更多的实习生，他们很棒。那些精力充沛的小混蛋很有想法。当他们可以质疑或批评某事时， 那就更妙了。我喜欢实习生。

- sip

  啜一口酒

- Don't meet your heroes. I paid 5k to take a course by one of my heroes. He's a brilliant man, but at the end of it I realized that he's making it up as he goes along like the rest of us.

  不要遇你的偶像。我花了 5k 买了我偶像的一个课程。他是个聪明人，但我最后意识到，他跟我们其他人一样胡编乱造。

- Tech stack matters. OK I just said tech stack doesn't matter, but hear me out. If you hear Python dev vs C++ dev, you think very different things, right? That's because certain tools are really good at certain jobs. If you're not sure what you want to do, just do Java. It's a shitty programming language that's good at almost everything.

  技术栈很重要。好吧我刚刚还说技术栈不重要来着，就当我没说。当你听到 Python 开发和 C++ 开发的时候，你会想到完全不同的东西，对吧？这是因为某些工具确实擅长某些工作。如果您不确定要做什么，那就做 Java。这是一个糟糕的编程语言，但它几乎干什么都好。

- The greatest programming language ever is lisp. I should learn lisp.

  有史以来最伟大的编程语言是 lisp。我应该学习 lisp。

- For beginners, the most lucrative programming language to learn is SQL. Fuck all other languages. If you know SQL and nothing else, you can make bank. Payroll specialtist? Maybe 50k. Payroll specialist who knows SQL? 90k. Average joe with organizational skills at big corp? \$40k. Average joe with organization skills AND sql? Call yourself a PM and earn \$​150k.

  对于初学者来说，最赚钱的编程语言是 SQL。操他妈的别的所有语言。如果你只会 SQL，你可以去银行。薪酬专员？大概5万美金。了解 SQL 的薪酬专员？90k。在大公司有领导能力的普通人？4万美元。有领导能力的普通人同时还会 SQL？打电话给 PM，让他给你 15 万美元。

- Tests are important but TDD is a damn cult.

  测试是重要的，但 TDD 是个邪教。

- Cushy government jobs are not what they are cracked up to be, at least for early to mid-career engineers. Sure, $120k + bennies + pension sound great, but you'll be selling your soul to work on esoteric proprietary technology. Much respect to government workers but seriously there's a reason why the median age for engineers at those places is 50+. Advice does not apply to government contractors.

  至少对于早期到中期的工程师来说，政府工作并不是他们所想的。当然，12万美元+福利+养老金听起来很棒，但你会出卖你的灵魂去搞别的地方用不上的技术。非常尊重政府工作人员，但说真的，为什么这些地方的工程师年龄中位数在 50 岁以上是有原因的。这个建议不适用于政府承包商。

- Third party recruiters are leeches. However, if you find a good one, seriously develop a good relationship with them. They can help bootstrap your career. How do you know if you have a good one? If they've been a third party recruiter for more than 3 years, they're probably bad. The good ones typically become recruiters are large companies.

  第三方招聘的人员就是蚂蝗。但是，如果你能找到一个好的，认真与他们发展良好的关系。他们可以帮助你促进你的职业生涯。你怎么知道你有一个好的？如果他们已经当了3年多的第三方招聘人员，他们可能是坏人。优秀的招聘人员通常是大公司的。

- Options are worthless or can make you a millionaire. They're probably worthless unless the headcount of engineering is more than 100. Then *maybe* they are worth something within this decade.

  毫无价值的东西也可能让你成为百万富翁。它们可能毫无价值，除非工程人员超过100人。那么*也许*在这十年内它们是值得的。

- Work from home is the tits. But lack of whiteboarding sucks.

  在家工作爽死了。但是没有白板就很糟糕。

- I've never worked at FAANG so I don't know what I'm missing. But I've hired (and not hired) engineers from FAANGs and they don't know what they're doing either.

  我从来没有在 FAANG 工作过，所以我不知道我错过了什么。但我从 FAANG 雇佣了工程师，他们也不知道自己在做什么。

- My self worth is not a function of or correlated with my total compensation. Capitalism is a poor way to determine self-worth.

  我的自我价值并不是和我的工资的相关联的。资本主义是决定自我价值的拙劣方法。

- Managers have less power than you think. Way less power. If you ever thing, why doesn't Manager XYZ fire somebody, it's because they can't.

  经理的权力比你想象的要小。如果你觉得为什么经理某某某不解雇某人，这是因为他们不能。

- Titles mostly don't matter. Principal Distinguished Staff Lead Engineer from Whatever Company, whatever. What did you do and what did you accomplish. That's all people care about.

  标题大多并不重要。无论是什么公司，你做了什么，完成了什么，这才是大家关心的。

- Speaking of titles: early in your career, title changes up are nice. Junior to Mid. Mid to Senior. Senior to Lead. Later in your career, title changes *down* are nice. That way, you can get the same compensation but then get an increase when you're promoted. In other words, early in your career (<10 years), title changes UP are good because it lets you grow your skills and responsibilities. Later, title changes down are nice because it lets you grow your salary.

  说到头衔：在职业生涯的早期，头衔的改变是不错的。在你的职业生涯的后期，头衔变低是不错的。这样，你可以得到同样的补偿，但当你被提升时，你会得到加薪。换句话说，在职业生涯的早期（<10年），头衔变更 高是好的，因为它可以让你增长你的技能和责任。后来，职称变动是不错的，因为它可以让你增加你的薪水。

- Max out our 401ks.

  要超出最大 401k 的限制了。

- Be kind to everyone. Not because it'll help your career (it will), but because being kind is rewarding by itself.

  善待每一个人。不是因为它会帮助你的事业（事实上确实会），而是因为善良本身就是有益的。

- If I didn't learn something from the junior engineer or intern this past month, I wasn't paying attention.

  如果上个月我没有从初级工程师或实习生那里学到什么，那就是因为我没有注意。

- Oops I'm out of wine.

  哎呀，不能再喝了。

- Paying for classes, books, conferences is worth it. I've done a few conferences, a few 1.5k courses, many books, and a subscription. Worth it. This way, I can better pretend what I'm doing.

  为课程，书籍，会议付钱是值得的。我参加过几次会议，几个1.5万美刀每门课程，还买了好多书，订了好多杂志。这一切是值得的，因为我可以假装我有事情做。

- Seriously, why aren't webdevs paid more? They know everything!!!

  说真的，为什么 Web 开发的薪水不高？他们什么都会!!!

- Carpal tunnel and back problems are no joke. Spend the 1k now on good equipment.

  腕管和背部问题不是开玩笑。赶紧花 1k 美刀买好设备。

- The smartest man I've every worked for was a Math PhD. I've learned so much from that guy. I hope he's doing well.

  我为之工作过的最聪明的人是一个数学博士。我从那家伙那里学到了很多东西。我希望他能好好的。

- Once, in high school, there was thing girl who was a great friend of mine. I mean we talked and hung out and shared a lot of personal stuff over a few years. Then there was a rumor that I liked her or that we were going out or whatever. She didn't take that too well so she started to ignore me. That didn't feel too good. I guess this would be the modern equivalent to "ghosting". I don't wish her any ill will though, and I hope she's doing great. I'm sorry I didn't handle that better.

  在高中时，有个女孩是我的好朋友。我的意思是，几年来，我们扯淡和分享了很多自己的东西。然后有传言说我喜欢她，或者我们要约出去什么的。她没能处理好那些流言蜚语，所以她开始不理我了。那种感觉不太好。我觉得这放在现在相当于" ghosting "。不过，我不希望她因此受伤，我希望她做得很好。很抱歉我没有处理得更好。

- I had a girlfriend in 8th grade that I didn't want to break up with even though I didn't like her anymore so I just started to ignore her. That was so fucked up. I'm sorry, Lena.

  我在八年级时有一个女朋友，即使我不喜欢她了也不想分手，所以我开始不理她。太糟糕了。对不起，莉娜。

- You know what the best part of being a software engineer is? You can meet and talk to people who think like you. Not necessarily the same interests like sports and TV shows and stuff. But they think about problems the same way you think of them. That's pretty cool.

  你知道做软件工程师最好的是什么吗？是你可以和像你一样思考的人见面和交谈。不一定要谈体育和电视节目之类的兴趣。但是他们像你一样看待问题、思考问题。这太酷了。

- There's not enough women in technology. What a fucked up industry. That needs to change. I've been trying to be more encouraging and helpful to the women engineers in our org, but I don't know what else to do.

  科技方面没有足够的女性。真是个糟糕的行业，这需要改变。我一直试图对我们组织中的女工程师给予更多鼓励和帮助，但我不知道还能做什么。

- Same with black engineers. What the hell?

  黑人工程师也是如此。

- I've never really started hating a language or technology until I started becoming intimately familiar with it. Also, I think a piece of tech is good if I hate it but I simultaneously would recommend it to a client. Fuck Jenkins but man I don't think I would be commuting software malpractice by recommending it to a new client.

  直到我开始熟悉一种语言或技术，我才会真正讨厌它。此外，我认为如果我讨厌一项技术，那它就是好的，我同时会推荐给客户。操他妈的 Jenkins，但我不认为我会把有故障的软件用在一个新的客户端上。

- That being said, git is awful and I have choice but to use it. Also, GUI git tools can go to hell, give me the command line any day. There's like 7 command lines to memorize, everything else can be googled.

  这就是说，git 是糟糕的，我没别的选择，只能用它。此外，GUI git 工具可以下地狱，每天都想教我一个新的命令。只要记住 7 个命令，其他一切都可以搜索。

- Since I work in data, I'm going to give a data-specific lessons learned. Fuck pandas.

  由于我做的大数据，我将给出一个数据分类的课。操他妈的 pandas 库。

- My job is easier because I have semi-technical analysts on my team. Semi-technical because they know programming but not software engineering. This is a blessing because if something doesn't make sense to them, it means that it was probably badly designed. I love the analysts on the team; they've helped me grow so much more than the most brilliant engineers.

  我的工作更容易，因为我的团队有半技术分析师。半技术，因为他们知道编程，但不是软件工程。这是一个好事，因为如果某样东西对他们来说没有意义，那意味着它可能设计得很糟糕。我喜欢团队中的分析师：他们对我成长的帮助比最聪明的工程师多得多

- Dark mode is great until you're forced to use light mode (webpage or an unsupported app). That's why I use light mode.

  黑暗模式是伟大的，除非你被迫使用 light 模式（网页或不受支持的应用程序）。这就是我使用 light 模式的原因。

- I know enough about security to know that I don't know shit about security.

  我对安全了解得够多了，知道我对安全一无所知。

- Crap I'm out of wine.

  不行了我不能再喝了。

- Being a good engineer means knowing best practices. Being a senior engineer means knowing when to break best practices.

  做一名优秀的工程师意味着了解最佳实践。作为一名高级工程师意味着知道何时打破最佳实践。

- If people are trying to assign blame to a bug or outage, it's time to move on.

  如果人们试图将责任归咎于错误或中断，是时候继续前进了。

- A lot of progressive companies, especially startups, talk about bringing your "authentic self". Well what if your authentic self is all about watching porn? Yeah, it's healthy to keep a barrier between your work and personal life.

  很多有野心的公司，尤其是初创公司，都在谈论带给你"真实的自我"。那么，如果你的真实自我是所有关于看色情呢？是的，在工作和个人生活之间设置阻隔是健康的。

- I love drinking with my co-workers during happy hour. I'd rather spend time with kids, family, or friends.

  我喜欢和同事一起喝酒的欢乐时光。我宁愿花时间陪孩子、家人或朋友。

- The best demonstration of great leadership is when my leader took the fall for a mistake that was 100% my fault. You better believe I would've walked over fire for her.

  伟大领导力的最好证明是，当我的领导人为一个 100% 是我的错误而担责时，我会为倾尽所有。

- On the same token, the best leaders I've been privileged to work under did their best to both advocate for my opinions and also explain to me other opinions 'that conflict with mine. I'm working hard to be like them.

  同样，我有幸工作过的最好的领导都尽了最大的努力来倡导我的意见，也向我解释其他与我相冲突的观点。我正在努力像他们一样。

- Fuck side projects. If you love doing them, great! Even if I had the time to do side-projects, I'm too damn busy writing drunken posts on reddit

  操他妈的子项目。如果你喜欢这样做，太好了！即使我有时间做子项目，我也会忙于在redit上写醉酒的帖子

- Algorithms and data strictures are important--to a point. I don't see pharmacist interviews test trivia about organic chemistry. There's something fucked with our industry's interview process.

  算法和数据结构很重要。从某方面来讲，我没有看到药剂师的面试谈有关有机化学的东西。我们行业的面试过程有些问题。

- Damn, those devops guys and gals are f'ing smart. At least those mofos get paid though.

  他妈的，那些开发和女性都很聪明，至少他们能拿到钱

- It's not important to do what I like. It's more important to do what I don't hate.

  做我喜欢做的事并不重要。做我不讨厌的事情更重要。

- The closer I am to the product, the closer I am to driving revnue, the more I feel valued regardless of how technical my work is. This has been true for even the most progressive companies.

  无论我的工作技术如何，我离产品越近，我钱就越多，我就越感到被重视。即使是最先进的公司也是如此。

- Linux is important even when I was working in all Windows. Why? Because I eventually worked in Linux. So happy for those weekend where I screwed around installing Arch.

  Linux是重要的，即使当我所有工作都在 Windows 下。为什么？因为我最终都要在 Linux 下工作。很高兴那些我搞砸了安装 Arch 的周末。

- I've learned to be wary for ambiguous buzz words like big data. WTF is "big" data? I've dealt with 10k rows streaming every 10 minutes in Spark and Kafka and dealt with 1B rows batched up hourly in Python and MySQL. Those labels can go fuck themselves.

  我学会了对像大数据这样模棱两可的流行语保持警惕。什么他妈的是"大"数据？我已经每10分钟在 Spark 和 Kafka 处理了10k行，每小时分批在Python和MySQL处理1B行。那些标签可以去操他们自己。

- Not all great jobs are in Silicon Valley. But a lot are.

  并不是所有好的工作都在硅谷。但很多都是。

Finally, if you really want to hurt me, don't downvote I don't care about that. Just ignore this post. Nothing makes me sadder than when I wrote a long post and then nobody responds. So if you hate this post, just ignore.

最后，如果你真的想伤害我，不要点踩，我不在乎。只需忽略此帖子。没有什么比写一篇长帖，然后没有人回应更让我伤心的了。所以，如果你讨厌这篇文章，只是忽略。
