谈论 Go 项目组织前，我不得不搬出 Go 语言作者 [@rsc](https://github.com/rsc) 的一则 comment：

{% github_issue https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout/issues/117#issuecomment-828503689 username="rsc" %}

There are two problems with this GitHub repo:

1. it claims to host Go standards and does not, in the sense that these are in no way official standards
2. the project-layout standard it puts forth is far too complex and not a standard

Regarding "why not tell us the standard Go project layout and we'll update the doc?", that only addresses point 2. If there really were standards, they would be in the main Go project doc tree. The standard for project layout would also be a lot shorter. I appreciate your trying to provide a useful resource, but calling it 'golang-standards' is claiming more than it is.

But for the record, the minimal standard layout for an importable Go repo is really:

- Put a `LICENSE` file in your root  
- Put a `go.mod` file in your root  
- Put Go code in your repo, in the root or organized into a directory tree as you see fit

That's it. That's the "standard".

In particular:

- It is *not* required to put commands in `cmd/`.  
- It is *not* required to put packages in `pkg/`.  
- It is *not* required to put web stuff in `web/`.  
- It is *not* required to put APIs in `api/`.  
- It is *not* required to put web stuff in `web/`.  
- It is *not* required to put configurations in `configs/`.  
- It is *not* required to put systemd scripts in `init/`.  
- It is *not* required to put shell scripts in `scripts/`.  
- It is *not* required to put Docker files in `build/package/`.  
- It is *not* required to put CI configs in `build/ci/`.  
- It is *not* required to put deployment configs in `deployments/`.  
- It is *not* required to put test support in `test/`.  
- It is *not* required to put documentation in `docs/`.  
- It is *not* required to put supporting tools in `tools/`.  
- It is *not* required to put examples in `examples/`.  
- It is *not* required to put third_party code in `third_party/`.  
- It is *not* required to put git hooks in `githooks/`.  
- It is *not* required to put static assets in `assets/`.  

The importable [golang.org/x](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x) repos break every one of these "rules".
