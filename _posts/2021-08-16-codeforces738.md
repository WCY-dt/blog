# A. Mocha and Math

[Problem - A - Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contest/1559/problem/A)

Combine all together.

# B. Mocha and Red and Blue

[Problem - B - Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contest/1559/problem/B)

Greedy. Just follow R with B and follow B with R.

# C. Mocha and Hiking

[Problem - C - Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contest/1559/problem/C)

If $a_0=1$​​, output $n+1, 1,2,\cdots,n$

Else if $a_n=0$​, output $1,2,\cdots,n$

Else find $k$ where $a_k=1$ and $a_{k-1}=0$, output $1,2,\cdots,k-1,n+1,k,k+1,\cdots,n$

Otherwise output $-1$

# D. Mocha and Diana

[Problem - D1 - Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contest/1559/problem/D1)

[Problem - D2 - Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contest/1559/problem/D2)

The answer is at most `N - 1 - max(m1, m2)`, and it is always achievable.

We can just arbitrarily add valid edges. Maintain the two forests using DSU. And then repeatedlly find two verticles that can be connected without creating a cycle.

We only need to check every pair of verticles once.

$O(n^2)$: Iterate every pair of edge

$O(n\log n)$: Vertex v is in a comp of size a in Mocha’s forest and size b in Diana’s forest. We only need to check min(a, n-b) vertices to find a vertex that can be connected to v, if one exists. 

Until we’ve added `N - 1 - max(m1, m2)`

- pick the smalledt CC in Mocha’s forest
- pick a vertex that satisfy `size(X)+size(Y)-size(X,Y)<N`

# E. Mocha and Stars

[Problem - E - Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/contest/1559/problem/E)

Möbius inversion. Here is a referrence: [Möbius function - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Möbius_function)

- $\mu(n)=1$ if n is not divisible by any perfect squares and it has an even number of prime factors
- $\mu(n)=-1$​ if same,except odd number of prime numbers
- $\mu(n)=0$​ if divisible by a square

$f(x)$ be the number of valid squences where all elements are divisible by $x$

the number of sequences with gcd 1 is the sum of $\mu(x)\cdot f(x)$​

$O(NM\log M)$: `dp[i][j]`= the number of ways to use the first $i$ sequences to achieve sum $j$

- `dp[i][0]=dp[i-1][0]`

- `dp[i][j]=dp[i][j-1]-dp[i-1][j-k-1]+dp[i-1][j]`
